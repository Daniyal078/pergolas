                <h5 class="text-black fw-bold text-center">LIFETIME LIMITED WARRANTY</h5>
                <p>SEE Enterprises, LLC Manufacturer’s LIFETIME LIMITED WARRANTY Coverage:
                    SEE Enterprises, LLC (SEE Enterprises) warrants the components used in the frame of the pergola
                    (posts, gutters, louvers, and beams, and fabricated aluminum parts) under normal use and service
                    conditions to be free of defects for as long as the customer owns their home.
                    SEE Enterprises also warrants the electronic components (motor, power supply, receiver, and
                    electronic controls) to be free of defects under normal use and service conditions for as long as
                    the customer owns their home. Batteries are not covered by this warranty. Somfy electronics are
                    warranted against defects for (5) years from date of shipment. 
                    All electric components are warranted subject to the wire connections being protected and to the
                    electric controls being installed in a waterproof box, in accordance with the relevant codes,
                    protected from water and other weather conditions and installed according to SEE Enterprises
                    installation instructions.
                    SEE Enterprises will at our expense and option correct any defects by repairing or replacing the
                    defective components. SEE Enterprises reserves the right to discontinue and make changes to any of
                    our products and in such event will substitute components that in our opinion are of equal grade,
                    quality, and price. Normal weathering and aging of existing components will preclude a perfect color
                    match of repaired or replaced components.
                    SEE Enterprises places intense importance on properly training dealer installation personnel;
                    however, as the manufacturer SEE Enterprises provides no warranty on the installation itself.
                    Transportation charges and installation labor charges are payable by the property owner in all cases
                    for warranty replacements.
                    Excluded from coverage:
                    Incorrect fasteners or use; normal wear and tear including fading, staining, streaking or chalking,
                    environmental effects including mildew, mold or pollution; rusting of steel components; components
                    that show evidence of damage caused by improper installation (i.e. contravention to building code,
                    SEE Enterprises guidelines or engineering documentation), chemicals or corrosives (including alkalis
                    or chlorides from cement based materials, de-icing chemicals and corrosive salt atmosphere), power
                    washing, accident, abuse, misuse, neglect, vandalism, fire, lightning, wind, earthquake, hailstorm
                    or other acts of God, any movement of the supporting structure, unauthorized repairs or
                    modifications, product that was not purchased new from SEE Enterprises or an authorized re-seller,
                    accessories, connected materials and products, or related products not manufactured by SEE
                    Enterprises.
                     <br>
                    Warranty Registration:
                    The property owner is automatically registered for their warranty from time of shipment. Complete
                    registration instructions are provided by SEE Enterprises or the Authorized SEE Enterprises Dealer
                    completing installation.
                    Transfer of Warranty:
                    This warranty is transferable by the original property owner to a successor owner of the property,
                    provided SEE Enterprises receives written notice of the transfer of title of all property within
                    thirty (30) <br>
                     <br>
                    days of the date of the transfer of ownership. Failure to give proper notification to SEE
                    Enterprises of property ownership transfer shall relieve SEE Enterprises of any further obligation
                    under this Limited <br>
                     <br>
                     <br>
                    Warranty and will result in the cancellation of warranty coverage. Please include the address of the
                    installation, the installing dealer, if applicable, and the date of installation. Alternatively, the
                    successor owner may request a new warranty registration card from SEE Enterprises which they may
                    fill out and return to SEE Enterprises noting that this is a transfer.
                    There is no charge for this transfer, however, SEE Enterprises must acknowledge in writing that the
                    new registration has been received. This Warranty only applies to product(s) installed within the
                    continental United States.
                    CLAIM PROCEDURE
                    Any claim under this warranty must be in writing to:
                    SEE Enterprises, LLC
                    17437 Carey Road #285
                    Westfield, IN 46074
                    Attention: Claim Clerk <br>
                    In the event of a claim, the writing should describe the claimed defect, date of the installation,
                    name of the installing dealer, and proof of purchase. Allow a reasonable time for inspection
                    purposes if determined to be necessary. Replacement parts provided by SEE Enterprises under this
                    warranty will have the standard color available at that time. A color variance may occur between new
                    parts or components in comparison with the original, due to color changes or weathering exposure and
                    would not be indicative of a defect in the part or component. NOTE: All repair / service decisions
                    are up to SEE Enterprises, i.e. part repair or replacement. Some parts may be repaired or repainted
                    vs. replaced. These decisions are SEE Enterprises decisions and may vary from original preparation
                    processes. <br>
                     <br>
                    The foregoing states the EXCLUSIVE REMEDY of the purchaser and the entire liability of SEE
                    Enterprises. SEE ENTERPRISES, LLC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY EVENT FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
                    DAMAGES. ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE LIMITED IN
                    TIME TO THE DURATION OF THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE.</p>
